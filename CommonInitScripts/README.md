# CommonInitScripts

Init script files that are shared between various platforms (e.g. git config script).

This directory contains only shared scripts that are executed during the init stage of the new machine (i.e. that need to be run as a part of the init script)

## TODO

1. consider converting some of the files to dotfiles (e.g. git config dotfiles)
