# How to use

Init scripts in Android_XX directory are designed to be used with [Termux app](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/).

NOTE: do not install the Termux app via Google play store as it has an outdated version, but rather use F-droid app store.

Once termux is installed continue as described in the main [README.md](https://github.com/jan-revay/initPC/blob/devel/README.md)
